EyyÃ¼b GÃ¼ven
Cognitive Neuroscientist | AI/ML Enthusiast | Clinical Psychology Researcher

Welcome to my personal website! Iâ€™m EyyÃ¼b GÃ¼ven, a cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist with a strong background in neuroimaging, machine learning, and deep learning, particularly within the fields of brain-computer interfaces, neurotechnology, and clinical psychology. Here, I showcase my journey, projects, and the research Iâ€™m passionate about.

ðŸ§  About Me
I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology from Ä°stanbul Esenyurt University and an M.Sc. in Cognitive Science from Nicolaus Copernicus University. My research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to understand and decode brain activity, with a vision to enhance the detection, prevention, and treatment of mental health conditions. I have worked in various interdisciplinary teams, applying my expertise in neuroscience, data science, and AI to push the boundaries of brain research.

ðŸŽ“ Academic Interests
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): Exploring how we can decode mental states and cognitive processes.
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Utilizing these technologies for brain disease detection, prevention, and treatment applications.
Clinical Psychology: Merging research with clinical applications, especially for conditions like ADHD, depression, and anxiety.
Rhythmic Patterns in Behavior and Cognition: Inspired by spiritual and ritualistic dance patterns, I am fascinated by rhythmic patterns in movement, cognition, and mental states.
ðŸ“‚ Projects
fNIRS-Vise: My masterâ€™s thesis project aimed at decoding visual stimuli using fNIRS data and deep learning techniques.
mmpi_turkish_os: A repository for MMPI calculations in Turkish, which supports clinical assessments and research in psychology.
fnirs_raw_data: A dataset created to facilitate transfer learning in fNIRS-based studies.
ðŸ’¼ Experience
Iâ€™ve collaborated on research projects in brain decoding, neurotechnology, and VR-based training applications. Additionally, I have experience with various neuroimaging modalities like EEG and fNIRS, along with extensive programming and data science skills. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply these skills to clinical settings, particularly in mental health and therapeutic interventions.
